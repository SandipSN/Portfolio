# Simple Banking System Project


## Languages used
Python, SQL

## Description
A simple comand line program that enables a user to create an account, log in, add and send fictional funds. The Luhn algorithm was used to validate card numbers, and check if user inputs a valid number. SQLite was employed to establish a database which could store these numbers as well as a PIN. This meant the user could log in after creating an account given they had the right cardnumber and PIN code match. The database also allowed for a user to send funds to another account if it existed in the database. 

## Project purpose
Practice Python and SQL skills. Application of key concepts such as classes, defintions, loops and conditional statements.
